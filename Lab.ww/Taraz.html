              Karakhan mausoleum is an architectural monument preserved in Kazakhstan from the 11th century. On the western outskirts of the modern city of Taraz. The mausoleum is located at the head of the tomb of the famous khan Sha-Mahmud Bugra Karakhan of the Karakhan dynasty. The mausoleum, whose only dome collapsed, has four walls and a double tower decorated with shiny bricks, which were preserved until the 90s of the 19th century. In 1905, the fallen part was completely demolished and replaced by a new mausoleum in 1906. The new construction was financed by Said Bakhanov, then a Tashkent trustee. The later mausoleum is different from the first.

            <p>
             Although the facade is similar to the mausoleum of Aisha Bibi, the brickwork is similar to the medieval Ismail dome in Bukhara. Karakhan mausoleum consists of a rectangular, spacious middle room and three small parts. The roof of the central room is covered like a yurt. There are two towers at the back. The front of the mausoleum faces south, and the tomb inside is located from right to left. The entrance door is decorated with an arched cavity. The inner walls of the mausoleum were built with their own bricks, and new bricks were used for the exterior.
